ðŸš€ End-to-End E-Commerce Data Analytics Project ðŸ“Š

As part of my NTI Data Analysis learning journey, I built this full pipeline project â€” transforming messy raw data into actionable insights and an interactive dashboard.

âœ… Designed the ERD & built the MySQL database
âœ… Inserted messy, real-world-like data
âœ… Cleaned & transformed data using Excel Power Query
âœ… Created measures & KPIs with DAX
âœ… Performed additional cleaning using Python and R
âœ… Loaded the cleaned data back into the database & executed SQL queries for deeper analysis
âœ… Built a dynamic, insight-rich Power BI dashboard
ðŸ’¡ This project demonstrates the complete analytics lifecycle â€” from data modeling to business insights.

Key Skills: SQL | Power Query | DAX | Python | R | Data Cleaning | Data Visualization | Power BI
